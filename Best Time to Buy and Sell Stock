Q:
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n<2) return 0; //boundary condition should be considered, as empty.
        int pre = prices[0];
        int max_profit = INT_MIN;
        for(int i = 1;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(prices[i]>pre)
             max_profit = max(max_profit,prices[i]-pre);
            else
             pre = prices[i];
        }
        return max_profit==INT_MIN?0:max_profit; //consider all the stock are decreasing.
    }
};
