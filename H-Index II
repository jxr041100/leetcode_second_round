Follow up for H-Index: What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm? 

Hint:
 1.Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.


class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        if(n==0) return 0;
        int left = 0,right = n-1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(left<=right)
        {
            mid = (left+right)/2;
            if(citations[mid]>=n-mid)
                right = mid-1;
            else
                left = mid+1;
        }
        return n-left;
    }
};
